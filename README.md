 <h2>My Task</h2> 
   <p>This weeks challenge is creating a portfolio web application which showcases the builds I have worked on. I have applied flex, grid, media quieries and CSS variables. When I have created and deployed the page I can come back and update it with my future works as I continue on my journey in web application development.</p>

 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  >AS A web application student<br/>
     I WANT a portfolio that showcases applications I have made<br/>
     SO THAT potential clients and employers can see my work<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>

  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To achieve accessibility standards I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you</li>
    <li>When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</li>
    <li>When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications</li>
    <li>When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others</li>
    <li>When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application</li>
    <li>When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I refered to HTML and CSS created for the second mini project.<br/>
   I also learnt new code from W3school.<br/>
  
  <br/>

 <h2>Visual References</h2>
 
  <br/>

  <p>Below are screenshots of my portfolio and how the page looks on differnt size devices. I have used media quieries to get this result</p>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>I wanted the grid to be displayed in columns when the page accessed in mobile view. To do this I added a media query, selected the grid and changed the grid-template-area.</li>
   <li>Using :hover in CSS will allow you to change how an element looks when the mouse is hovering over it.</p>
